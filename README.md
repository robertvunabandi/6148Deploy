Hey. Try not to edit input types, input and form names and ID's.  

DON'T EXPLICITLY MODIFY THE CSS FILE. Install an SCSS compiler to your laptop, and edit the SCSS FILE. Otherwise, the SCSS will not convert to css.  
Essentially, the SCSS gets compiled into the CSS, that's why you'll see a very crunched up CSS file. (here, i am talking about main.css). KOALA IS THE ONE I USE.  

Notify in case you change any of the id or classes.  
Don't remove handlebars in HBS files ( look like -> {{ name }} ).  

Use for color schemes: [https://robertvunabandi.github.io/ColorSchemeTest/](colorscheme), [http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hex-to-rgb.htm](convert HEX to RGB).
