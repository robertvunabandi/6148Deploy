Hey. Please try not to edit input types, input and form names and ID's.  

DON'T EXPLICITLY MODIFY THE CSS FILE. Install an SCSS compiler to your laptop, and edit the SCSS FILE. Otherwise, the SCSS will not convert to css  
Essentially, the SCSS gets compiled into the CSS, that's why you'll see a very crunched up CSS file. (here, i am talking about main.css).  

Notify in case you change any of the id or classes.  

Don't remove handlebars in HBS files ( look like -> {{ name }} ).  

I have not implemented a login , so that's something that needs to be done. Someone work on scss and look.
